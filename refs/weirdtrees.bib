	Abstract = {In 2003, Europe experienced its hottest summer in >500 years. Satellite‐derived photosynthetic activity estimates across the Alps revealed a pattern of high elevation growth enhancement and low elevation growth suppression in response to these extreme summer temperatures. Surface weather‐derived effective growing season lengths were shorter in 2003 by an average of 9\% and 5\% for colline and montane areas respectively and were 2\%, 12\% and 64\% longer for subalpine, alpine and nival areas respectively. In situ forest growth measurements of 244 trees at 15 sites across Switzerland verified this pattern and revealed that this divergent response was consistent between species. We suggest that warmer summer temperatures lengthened the snow‐free growing season at high elevations while they increased summertime evaporative demand at lower elevations. Our investigation demonstrates that climatic changes are affecting plants beyond simply shifting the elevation belts upwards.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The temperature dependence of C3 photosynthesis is known to vary with growth environment and with species. In an attempt to quantify this variability, a commonly used biochemically based photosynthesis model was parameterized from 19 gas exchange studies on tree and crop species. The parameter values obtained described the shape and amplitude of the temperature responses of the maximum rate of Rubisco activity (Vcmax) and the potential rate of electron transport (Jmax). Original data sets were used for this review, as it is shown that derived values of Vcmax and its temperature response depend strongly on assumptions made in derivation. Values of Jmax and Vcmax at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C varied considerably among species but were strongly correlated, with an average Jmax : Vcmax ratio of 1·67. Two species grown in cold climates, however, had lower ratios. In all studies, the Jmax : Vcmax ratio declined strongly with measurement temperature. The relative temperature responses of Jmax and Vcmax were relatively constant among tree species. Activation energies averaged 50 kJ mol−1 for Jmax and 65 kJ mol−1 for Vcmax, and for most species temperature optima averaged 33 $\,^{\circ}$C for Jmax and 40 $\,^{\circ}$C for Vcmax. However, the cold climate tree species had low temperature optima for both Jmax(19 $\,^{\circ}$C) and Vcmax (29 $\,^{\circ}$C), suggesting acclimation of both processes to growth temperature. Crop species had somewhat different temperature responses, with higher activation energies for both Jmax and Vcmax, implying narrower peaks in the temperature response for these species. The results thus suggest that both growth environment and plant type can influence the photosynthetic response to temperature. Based on these results, several suggestions are made to improve modelling of temperature responses.},

@article{Oren1999,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Responses of stomatal conductance (gs) to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D) generally follow an exponential decrease described equally well by several empirical functions. However, the magnitude of the decrease -- the stomatal sensitivity -- varies considerably both within and between species. Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of gs to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of gs at low D (≤ 1 kPa). To test this relationship we used the function gs=gsref--m· lnD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and gsref=gs at D= 1 kPa. Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with gsref (average r2= 0·75) with a slope of approximately 0·6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of gs in relation to leaf‐surface D (Ds), or on sap flux‐based stomatal conductance of whole trees (GSi), or stand‐level stomatal conductance (GS) in relation to D. Thus, individuals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential.},

These aspects include the kinetic properties of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase; the requirements of the photosynthetic carbon reduction and photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycles for reduced pyridine nucleotides; the dependence of electron transport on photon flux and the presence of a temperature dependent upper limit to electron transport. The measurements of gas exchange with which the model outputs may be compared include those of the temperature and partial pressure of CO2(p(CO2)) dependencies of quantum yield, the variation of compensation point with temperature and partial pressure of O2(p(O2)), the dependence of net CO2 assimilation rate on p(CO2) and irradiance, and the influence of p(CO2) and irradiance on the temperature dependence of assimilation rate.},

@article{Franks1999,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Gas exchange experiments were performed with 13 plant species that differ from each other in growth‐form and natural habitat. These comprised three herbaceous species, two ferns, two temperate deciduous trees, five rainforest trees and one liana from wet tropical forest. The aims were to investigate whether plants of similar growth‐form and from similar habitats tended to respond similarly to a change in leaf‐to‐air vapour pressure difference (VPD), and to compare their ratio of intercellular to ambient partial pressures of CO2 for given conditions. Leaves were subjected to a step change in VPD and the initial and final steady rates of transpiration were used to calculate an index of sensitivity, φ, which enabled comparison of species. The results suggest that species of similar growth‐form and habitat respond similarly to increasing VPD, with the temperate deciduous trees undergoing a greater reduction in stomatal conductance than the herbaceous plants in well‐watered soil. Also, for these experimental conditions, the ratio of leaf internal to ambient CO2 partial pressure (pi/pa) was positively correlated with both CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal insensitivity to VPD, across the 13 species. The results are discussed in terms of growth strategies and possible advantages and limitations of hydraulic systems in different plants.},
